 Time complexity alogrithm is depend on
First ceate a hypothetical macthine
1. single processor
2. 32 bit
3. sequential execution
4.  1 unit time for arithmatic and logical operation
5.  1 Uinit Time for assignment and return



Example :

function (a+b){

 return a+b; // the time complexity for this function is 2=> 1 for the a+b and 1 for the return statement.

}

Example 2.

Sum of list.


function (array, length of the array){

 total = 0 ; // T1

for i=0 to n-1    2T(n+1) n times + 1 for the false condition

  total = total+Ai    // 2T for the n cycle so time taken is 2T(n)

return total  ;   T1
}

So, total time taken is :: T1+ 2T(n+1)+2Tn+T1
T is time unit
so, Time taken is  =   (4n+4)T time
so, this time is proportional to n
so
T-factor = n

Asymptotic notation Big-O


Like this

Sum of matrix will be

n2

------> O(n2)
