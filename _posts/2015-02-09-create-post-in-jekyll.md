#How to create post in Jekyll 
I just started with Jekyll and imported blog from blogger. I wanted to do this as markdown are easy and fast to created new post.
So, everything was success and easy from importing blog to serving on github using my username.
Here comes the obvios question. How to write and serve the post on the jekyll. Well that is easy.

> 1. Create on draft in the `_draft` folder if you don't have than just do `mkdir -p _draft` -p for the safer side.
  2. now create file for the post 

Here is some example of the ruby code 

{% highlight ruby %}
def hello
  p "Hello bro"
end

{% endhighlight %}


```ruby

def hello
  p "hey this is good"

end

```
