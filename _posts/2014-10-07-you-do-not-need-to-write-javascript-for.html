<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">If you are a front end developer, you need to create forms.<br />Forms should be nice looking and validation should be there to give user a nice experience and save their time.<br /><br />For validations we need to write a lot of javascript and same for the placeholders.<br />with HTML5 there is a good news for all of the developers. New form attributes do this for us.<br />I am using these attributes since there were there. But some of us seems to be anware of this as they are busy working and have little time to explore.<br /><br />For this i am writing this tutorial.<br /><br />&lt;form action="#" method="post" enctype="multipart"&gt;<br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;/form&gt;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Note: this is incomplete and i will do this after some time.</div>
