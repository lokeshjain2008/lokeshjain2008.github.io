## web scrapping with ruby 

Ruby is very user friendly language. I like this computer language to complete all my needs.
I find many solutions to accomplish this task. 

There are solutions like. 

1. basic approach to web scrapping using css,xml parser `nokogiri` gem
2. [Wombat](https://github.com/felipecsl/wombat) Great gem to complete the task
3. [Link](http://ngauthier.com/2014/06/scraping-the-web-with-ruby.html) my favorite this solution uses my fav. gem `capybara`.
