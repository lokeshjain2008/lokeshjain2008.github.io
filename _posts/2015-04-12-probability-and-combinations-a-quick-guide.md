Probabilites and combinations are very difficult for me understand because i always keep forgetting what they mean.

lets start with some basic examples.

__ Example 1: __


What is the probality that we will get `head` when we flip the coin


```
formula 1
P(h) = No. of posssible outcomes that meat our condition/ All possible conditions

``` 

solution


`P(h) =  1/2(head+tail)`

__ Example 2: __

What is the posssibity that we will get number less than 4 when roll a dice.

```
p(answer) = 3(that can be 1, 2 and 3 on the dice)/ 6(total outcome of dice)

```

__ Example 3: __


There are some cases we need van-diagram to solve the problem like 
** Scenerio **
if there are 4 red dice, 3 red cube and 4 yellow cube then

What is the probality to get red cube 

```
P = 3/11

```

__ Example 4: __ compound outcome

You're playing a game where you defend your village from an orc invasion. There are 3 characters (elf, hobbit, or human) and 5 defense tools (magic, sword, shield, slingshot, or umbrella) to pick from.

If you randomly choose your character and tool, what is the probability that you won't be a hobbit or use an umbrella?

There are \blue 3 character choices and \pink 5 choices for the tool, so there are \blue3\times\pink5=3Ã—5=15 total possible combinations. If we pick randomly, all the combinations are equally likely.
here are  8 favorable combinations.

so 

```
P = 8/15
```

__ Example 5: __

There are some question needed tree view like this.
