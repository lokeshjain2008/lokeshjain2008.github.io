#Fat arrow(lamdba like) in JavaScript.

I have been using `->` in CoffeeScript to create function.

```coffee
hello = ->(a,b)
	a+b
```

{% highlight coffee %}
hello = ->(a,b)
	a+b
{%  endhighlight %}

#### for the git, for the project 'Jekyll blog'
i made huge change on the files. it commited and i am sure that i want to use it for now.
ON the other machine i had to make a pull request "There will be conflicts on the branch"
`git pull -X theirs`
but i did pull now there were some coflicts.

How do i solve it now. 
git checkout --theirs/--ours <fileName>
this was a life saver for me.r
